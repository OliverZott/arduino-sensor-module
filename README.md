## Fehlerbehandlung & Modularisierung

Ex.: lux-Sensor error (error.log)

1.Step:
C-Code for Arduino: array<float,3>

2.Step:
C-Code for Arduino: vector / struct instead array  

3.Step:
.err and.log files

4.Step:
Fehlerbehandlung (exception handling)

5.Step:
Modularisierung / OOP

## Sensors and Python

1.Step:
Test python script with arduino-temp sensor module  - done

2.Step:
include lux-sensor and test python script again   - done

adding: loops for automated value logging   - done
 if-branches for automated value logging   - done
 test clock-time      - done

3.Step:

## Wireless Communication

1.Step:
Test Modules

- RFID        -
- 433 MHz      -
- 2.4 GHz      - done (low range!)

2.Step:
tweak RANGE!       -

3.Step:
send AND recive

## Combining (PCB + Nano)

1.Step:
Erster Versuchsaufbau auf einem BreadBoard   - done (2.4GHz)

2.Step:
Soldering on PCB      -

## Auswertung

1.Step:
Automated GnuPlot charts     - done

## Linux installation

Sure, here are the steps to install Arduino IDE 2 on Ubuntu:

Update your system: Make sure your system is up-to-date. You can either use the Software Updater tool in the GUI or type these commands in a terminal1:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

Download the Arduino IDE: Download the ZIP file for Arduino IDE 2 from the official website12.

Extract the archive: Once you have the file on your computer, you can use the graphic interface to extract the files. Right-click on the file in your Downloads folder and choose “Extract” in the menu. It will create a new folder named “arduino-ide_VERSION” with all the application files inside it1.

Run the application: Double-click on the “arduino-ide” file to start the application1.

To enable the Arduino IDE to access the serial port and upload code to your board, you can add the following rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/99-arduino.rules2:

SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0666"

Please replace 2341 with the vendor ID of your Arduino board. You can find this by running lsusb in the terminal and looking for the ID next to ‘Arduino’.

Remember to restart the udev service after adding this rule:

sudo service udev restart

Now, you should be able to use Arduino IDE 2 on your Ubuntu system. Enjoy coding! 😊

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can open the arduino.rules file using a command-line text editor like nano. Here’s how you can do it:

Open a terminal.

Type the following command and press Enter:

sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-arduino.rules

This command opens the 99-arduino.rules file in the nano text editor with root permissions. If the file doesn’t exist, this command will create it.

After you’ve made your changes, you can save and close the file by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y to confirm saving, and finally Enter to confirm the file name.
Remember, you need to have sudo privileges to edit this file. If you’re not comfortable using nano, you can replace it with your preferred text editor like vim or emacs. If you’re not familiar with these editors, nano is a good choice because it’s easy to use. 😊

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The error message you’re seeing typically indicates a permissions issue with the serial port /dev/ttyACM0. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

Add your user to the dialout group123: This command adds your user to the group that has access to the serial ports.
sudo adduser $USER dialout

Change permissions for the serial port143: This command grants read/write permissions to all users for the serial port.
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0

Restart your system: After running these commands, you’ll need to log out and log back in, or restart your system, for the changes to take effect23.
If you’re still having trouble, it’s possible another process is using the serial port. You can check this by running lsof /dev/ttyACM0 in the terminal1. If a process is using the port, you’ll need to terminate it before you can upload your sketch.

Please replace $USER with your username when running these commands. Let me know if this helps! 😊
